# todo-app

Based on the concept of TodoMVC. Used for learning/testing various web frameworks, etc.

# About

I needed a good place to learn and compare the code of difference web frameworks/libraries/etc (initially this will be [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)). This is the repo I created for that purpose.

# Project Structure

This repo will primarily be used to organize other links as sub-repos to the project (one sub-repo for each example). Those repos can be found in the `src` directory.
